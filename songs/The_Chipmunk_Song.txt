Christmas, Christmas time is near,
Time for toys and time for cheer.
We've been good, but we can't last,
Hurry Christmas, Hurry fast.
Want a plane that loops the loop,
[Alvin:] Me, I want a Hula-Hoop.
[Chipmunks:]
We can hardly stand the wait,
Please Christmas don't be late.

Please Christmas don't be late.
We can hardly stand the wait,
Please Christmas don't be late.
