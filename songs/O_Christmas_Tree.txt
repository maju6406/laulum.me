Much pleasure doth thou bring me!

O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
Thy candles shine out brightly!
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
Thy candles shine out brightly!
Each bough doth hold its tiny light,
That makes each toy to sparkle bright.

A symbol of good will and love,
You'll ever be unchanging.
Each shining light, each silver bell,
No other sight spreads cheer so well.

You'll ever be unchanging.

O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree!
How are thy leaves so verdant!
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,

But even in winter is thy prime.
