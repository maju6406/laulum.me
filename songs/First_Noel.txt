First Noel


The first noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay.
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep,
In a cold winter's night that was so deep.

noel, noel, noel, noel.
Born is the King of Israel.

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East, beyond them far,
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued, both day and night.

noel, noel, noel, noel.
Born is the King of Israel.

And by the light of that same Star
Three Wise Men came from country far,
To seek for a King was their intent,
And to follow the Star wherever it went.
noel, noel, noel, noel.
Born is the King of Israel.
This Star drew nigh to the North West;
O'er Bethlehem it took it's rest.
And there it did both stop and stay,
Right over the place where Jesus lay.
noel, noel, noel, noel.
Born is the King of Israel.

Then did they know assuredly
Within that house, the King did lie
One entered in then for to see
And found the babe in poverty.

noel, noel, noel, noel.
Born is the King of Israel.

Then entered in those Wise Men three,
Full reverently upon bended knee,
And offer'd there, in his presence,
Their gold, and myrrh, and frankincense.

noel, noel, noel, noel.
Born is the King of Israel.

Between an ox stall and an ass,
This Child truly there he was;
For want of clothing they did him lay
All in a manger, among the hay.

noel, noel, noel, noel.
Born is the King of Israel.

Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord;
That hath made heaven and earth of nought,
And with his blood mankind hath bought.


noel, noel, noel, noel.
Born is the King of Israel.

If we in our time shall do well
We shall be free from death and Hell
For God hath prepared for us all
A resting place in general.

noel, noel, noel, noel.
Born is the King of Israel.
