All I Want For Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth


All I want for Christmas
Is my two front teeth
My two front teeth
Just my two front teeth
Gee, if I could only have
My two front teeth
Then I could wish you Merry Christmas

It seems so long since I could say,
"Sister Suzy sitting on a thistle"
Gosh, oh gee
How happy I'd be
If I could only "whithle"
All I want for Christmas
Is my two front teeth
My two front teeth
Just my two front teeth
Gee, if I could only have my two front teeth
Then I could wish you Merry Christmas

All I want for Christmas
Is my two front teeth
My two front teeth
Just my two front teeth
Gee, I if I could only have my two front teeth
Then I could wish you Merry Christmas

Santa Claus and his reindeer
Used to bring me lots of toys and candy
But now when I try to call their names
None of them can understand me

All I want for Christmas
Is my two front teeth
My two front teeth
Just my two front teeth
Gee, if I could only have my two front teeth
Then I could wish you Merry Christmas
Then I could wish you Merry Christmas
Then I could wish you merry Christmas
