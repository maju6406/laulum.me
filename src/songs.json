sweet,\nWhile shepherds watch are keeping?\nThis, this is Christ the King,\nWhom shepherds guard and Angels sing;\nHaste, haste, to bring Him laud,\nThe Babe, the Son of Mary.\n\nWhy lies He in such mean estate,\nWhere ox and ass are feeding?\nGood Christians, fear, for sinners here\nThe silent Word is pleading.\nNails, spear shall pierce Him through,\nThe cross be borne for me, for you.\nHail, hail the Word made flesh,\nThe Babe, the Son of Mary.\n\nSo bring Him incense, gold and myrrh,\nCome peasant, king to own Him;\nThe King of kings salvation brings,\nLet loving hearts enthrone Him.\nRaise, raise a song on high,\nThe virgin sings her lullaby.\nJoy, joy for Christ is born,\nThe Babe, the Son of Mary.\n"},{"id":52,"name":"White
